                    circuit designing and so on. However, I'm not the type of students who only focus on knowledge
                    absorbing. During my spare time, I also take part in many voluntary works and contests. After
                    graduation, I would pursue a graduate degree abroad and broaden my horizons in the mean time. I'm
                    glad that I can finish my undergraduate study with my excellent friends and teammate in VE/VM450.
                    Hope that we can learn a lot in this capstone project.</p>

                    for two years. I also love drawing with water color and ipad. I travel a lot during my leisure time
