            <p class="lead">
                The design of refrigerator doors has a huge impact on the kitchen workflow and quality of life. In this
                project, we will propose an innovative design of refrigerator doors to meet the demands of young
                customers in middle and high-end market. So far, we have completed literature survey, user interview and
                market research. Based on both qualitative and quantitative research on customers' needs, we find that
                an automatic door opening system with voice recognition, a quality guarantee period reminder and a
                defrost zone are the main demands. We contribute to building a prototype with the above functions, while
                receiving feedback from users and do further modifications. The expected deliverable would be an
                interactive refrigerator door model based on Raspberry Pi microcontroller, with embedded voice
                recognition system and intelligent user interface powered by Python modules.

                To solve the design problems raised from the beginning of the project, which are listed
                below, we have dug into the refrigerator market and made research on the existing models, in order to
                specify the target customers and product pricing. With a clear consumer background, we may proceed to
                investigate and audit their needs to meet the project qualification. More specifically, we would focus
                on young customers aged from 25 to 30 with considerable consumption level,and the product will be
                targeted for middle/high-end market.

            <h1 class="mb-3">Customer Requirement</h1>

            <p class="lead">
                For this project, we set our target customer to be office employees aged between 25 to 40. To understand
                the needs of our customers better, we have conducted a survey and asked people some questions regarding
                their lifestyle and preference for refrigerators. We have collected 121 surveys so far, and we are still
                collecting more.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                The outcome shows that 71.9% of the interviewees fall into our designed age
                range while 94.21% of them are office workers. Therefore, our survey is valid and
                the results are reliable. Based on their responses, more than half of the respondents
                have or would have purchased a house of their own, indicating that they are willing to invest more on
                house appliances. Given their average salaries and housing
                habits, the overall cost of our design product should be less than 7000 RMB. Another thing to notice is
                that 57.85% of them are more fond of open­style kitchen
                than traditional enclosed kitchen. As a result, appearance design also matters a
                lot in our project. We intend to apply Piet Cornelies Mondrian's art style into our
                prototype design. The outcome should have parts in different colors and be placed
                in asymmetrical style.

                Most of the people think that current refrigerator door is inconvenient to open,
                since it is a little bit heavy and one cannot open it when they are holding food
                in their hands. According to the current survey result, 68.6% of the respondents
                open refrigerator doors more than three times a day. Therefore, it's necessary for
                us to design an automatic opening system to satisfy our customers' needs. 60% of
                our interviewees prefer voice controlled automatic door over gesture controlled or
                button controlled ones. So as to meet this demand, we are going to design
                a software that is capable of recognizing voice commands and control the opening
                of corresponding door. The designed test case is 500 and the error rate should be
                less than 2%.

            <p class="lead">
                The survey also reveals the need for a system that can remind people of
                the quality guarantee period of the food stored in the refrigerator. Statistics show that only 8.26%
                of
                surveyed people say that they never forget to consume the food stored in their refrigerators, while
                the
                rest says that they often forget to do this. Therefore, we decide to implement a quality guarantee
                period reminder system into the refrigerator door through a digital screen, where users can input
                the
                food information and the refrigerator will make alarm when some food is near the best consumption
                date.

                When being asked the necessity of adding a defrost zone into the refrigerator,
                66.94% of the interviewees thinks that it is a good idea. Since most office
                workers need to go to work early in the morning, they can easily forget to defrost
                food beforehand, and food can easily go bad in summer if being put outside the
                refrigerator for a long period. Therefore, we decide to add a defrost area to our
                refrigerator, which indicates that we need to add an extra door.

                Based on our analysis of target customers, customer needs and project requirements, and the
                corresponding engineering specifications, we have come up with the following QFD chart for this project.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                For the need that the refrigerator has to be moderately priced, we've related
                it mainly to cost and the door material we will be using. Customers also require
                that the total storage space needs to be large, so we included it and related it to
                width, length, depth and volume. To make our design product coordinates with
                kitchen decorations, door material should be carefully chosen so that both the appearance and
                functionality are guaranteed. Since a separate section with a corresponding door is needed for the
                implementation of the defrost area, the unfreezing
                unit should be related to the length, width, depth and volume. To build up voice controlled door, we
                separated it to the hardware part and the software part. For the
                automatic door, we need to consider its respond time; for the voice control system,
                it is implemented into the interactive digital screen. Both of them are related to
                test case numbers, error rate and respond time. For the quality guarantee period
                reminder system and the capability to join smart home appliance system, we also
                need to implement software into the refrigerator, so they are relevant with the same specifications.
                Lastly, to make the refrigerator durable and energy saving, we may
                spend more to use green and energy saving technology.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
                For the 10 listed customer needs, we've marked the most important and relevant aspects with level 9,
                such as "coordinates with kitchen decorations", "defrost
                area" and etc., since they are directly related to our refrigerator door design. Other
                aspects are considered less important. We've set the total size of the refrigerator
                door to be 180cm*80cm*20cm, and the total volume to be 550L. The temperature
                for different functioning areas needs to be set differently according to actual needs.
                For the software parts, we've decided to run 500 test cases and keep an error rate
                below 2%. The estimated total cost is 10000 RMB. Comparing to the benchmarks,
                our design has lower cost, possesses more functions and is much closer to customer
                needs.
